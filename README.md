# FileMyRun
A tool for runners using garmin devices to track their activities. 

Download the tcx file of your activity from the garmin connect web site.
When you start FileMyRun, the download folder will be scanned for new
tcx files. The found files are imported and moved to a backup directory.
Then you can add some more data to your activity and analize it.

Have fun.
